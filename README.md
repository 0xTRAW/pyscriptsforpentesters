### Day 2 Creating An FTP Brute-Forcer(ftpbust3r)
In this tutorial you will learn how to crack ftp servers using dictionary attack(brute force with a word-list) with the help of a ftplib module in python. A brute-force attack is an attack that submits many passwords to a password protected file or service with the hope of guessing correctly.
